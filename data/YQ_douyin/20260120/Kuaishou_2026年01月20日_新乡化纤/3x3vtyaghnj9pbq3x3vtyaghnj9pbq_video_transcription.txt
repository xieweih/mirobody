Or are we waving at cars, just watching them pass? Is that who we are? Just stuck at the start, watching them go by, waiting for our ride, wondering if we're gonna be alright. Waving at cars, wishing they were ours. Why are we waving at cars, just watching them pass? Is that all we are? Just waving@cars.We could spend the night going round.
