To all my friends, the night is young.The music's loud, they're playing our song.We can drop this dress inside a ember.This night got started when you entered.I hope we can get a little closer.Maybe even get to know your name.I wanna hear the music so loud.Get some drinks inside me right now.So baby, let it go.You had me at hello.Let's raise our glass and toast.Music play that one.
To all my friends, the night is young.The music's loud, they're playing our song.There's nowhere else that I belongThan here with you.And they say the sun's out to be known, eh?If you got some money, time to blow it.Cause the way you got me feeling so sick,Passing out away with you, with you, with you.
Yeah, nobody is sober. Last call don't mean it's over, yeah. So baby, let it go. You had me at hello. Let's raise our glass and toast, pop, pop, close. To all my friends, the night is young, the music's loud, they're playing our song. There's nowhere else that I belong than here with you, than here with you, than here with you. I wanna hear the music so loud. Hear the music so loud.
To all my friends, the night is young.The music's loud, they're playing our song.There's nowhere else that I belongThan here with you, than here with you,Than here with you, than here with you.Than here with you, oh, than here with you.
