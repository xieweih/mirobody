============================================================

Was our company was running out of money, and I had I was in a contract with Sega, and I owed them this game console. And if that contract would have been canceled, we'd be dead. We would have vaporized instantly. And so, so I went to Japan and I explained to the CEO of Sega, Iri Majuri, really great man. He was the former CEO of Honda USA, went back to Sega to run Sega, went back to Japan to run Sega. And I explained to him that I was, I guess I was what, 30, 33 years old. You know, when I was 33 years old, I still had acne. And I got this, you know, Chinese kid, I was super skinny. And he was already kind of elder.
I went to him and I said, "I said, listen, I've got some bad news for you. And 1st , the technology that we promised you doesn't work. And 2nd , we shouldn't finish your contract because we'd waste all your money and you would have something that doesn't work. And I recommend you find another partner to build your game console. Whoa. And so I'm terribly sorry that we've set you back in your product roadmap. And 3rd , even though you're gonna, I'm asking you to let me out of the contract, I still need the money because if you didn't give me the money, we'd vaporize overnight."
And so I explained it to him humbly, honestly. I gave him the background, explained to him why the technology doesn't work, why we thought it was going to work, why it doesn't work. And I asked him to convert the last $5 million that they were going to complete the contract to give us that money as an investment instead. And he said, but it's very likely your company will go out of business even with my investment. And it was completely true. Back then, 1995, $5 million was a lot of money. It's a lot of money today. $5 million was a lot of money. And here's a pile of competitors doing it right. What are the chances?
That giving NVIDIA $5 million , that we would develop the right strategy, that he would get a return on that $5 million or even get it back, 0 % . You do the math, is 0 % . If I were sitting there right there, I wouldn't have done it. $5 million was a mountain of money to Sega at the time. And so I told him that if you invested that $5 million in us, it is most likely to be lost. But if you didn't invest that money, we'd be out of business and we would have no chance. And I told him that I don't even know exactly what I said in the end, but I told him that I would understand if he decided not to.
But it would make the world to me if he did. He went off and thought about it for a couple days and came back and said, "We'll do it. " Wow. Did you have a strategy to how to correct what it was doing wrong? Oh, wait, wait, oh man, wait until I tell you the rest of it's it's scary, even scarier. Oh no. And so, so, so what he what he decided was was Jensen was a young man he liked. That's it. Wow, to this day, that's nuts. I was boy, you owe, but the world owes that guy, no doubt, right? Like, what a he's he's celebrated today in Japan. And if he would have kept that five the investment, I think it'd be worth probably about a trillion dollars today.
I know, but the moment we went public, they sold it. They goes, "Wow, that's a miracle!" And so they sold it. Yeah, they sold it at NVIDIA valuation about 300 million . That's our IPO valuation, 300 million . Wow. And so, anyhow, I was incredibly grateful.
