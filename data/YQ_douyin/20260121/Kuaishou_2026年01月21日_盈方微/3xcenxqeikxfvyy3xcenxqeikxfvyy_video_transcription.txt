============================================================

It's swept around in motion, the wind I am in knowing the reason for its blowing. Emotion on the ocean, the moon still keeps on moving, the waves still keep on waving, and I still keep on going. You go there, I go there, I go there, I look that way, we stay here, we move to there, anywhere is. I wonder if the stars I feel like that is to be mine. If they let their light shine, and no more need to follow, I look up to the heavens, the night is.
