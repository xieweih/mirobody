============================================================

I want to thank President Trump for giving me the pardon. So yeah, it's an interesting year. It's always very hard to predict the future, especially 2026. There's two trends in play. There's historically four-year cycles in crypto, then that's not very good for 2026. Then if we go by four-year cycles, it could be the start of a bear market. Then again, the US policy is very pro-crypto. And also, I'm not very into politics, I'm not an expert there, but there's a midterm election coming up next year. I believe the US President Trump probably judges his performance by the stock market. So with rate cuts, quantitative easing, new Fed chair discussions, etc. So I think the stock market probably will do well. So I think President Trump probably will do everything to make the stock market do well. And if the stock market is doing well, it's usually good for crypto because people have extra cash, you know, they invest in crypto, they diversify their investments, etc. So that will most likely be positive for crypto. Which forces is going to take hold? I don't know. So it's going to be an interesting year. I think it's possible for there to be a super cycle, but again, I'm not very good at predicting.
It's very hard to read right now. I'm very confident on the US's ability to lead economic development in the world right now.
