**Prioritizing the Overwrite**

I'm focused on the user's explicit desire to overwrite the local `docker-compose.yaml` file during the merge conflict. My primary goal is to ensure this action happens efficiently and safely, minimizing potential data loss. I'm exploring the safest and most direct git commands to achieve this overwrite without unintended consequences.


**Examining the Terminal Error**

I'm now carefully examining the terminal output to fully grasp the merge conflict details. The error specifically flags `docker/docker-compose.yaml` as the problematic untracked file, ready to be overwritten. My focus is on crafting a solution that aligns perfectly with the user's "overwrite local" preference, ensuring the least disruptive approach. I am now evaluating the git commands that directly address this scenario.


**Evaluating the Command Request**

I'm assessing the user's intent to overwrite the local `docker-compose.yaml` file, understanding the error context. The terminal output clearly identifies the conflict. Since the user said "解决一下" (Fix it), I'm leaning toward EXECUTE mode, but the rules dictate I stay in ANALYZE & BRAINSTORM until explicitly told to switch. I'm now comparing possible command solutions, mindful of safety and efficiency, and considering asking the user for a confirmation to switch modes or directly proceed.


**Contemplating Mode Transition**

I'm now wrestling with the mode transition dilemma. The user's directive to "解决一下" (Fix it) seems to imply immediate action. I am torn. The user's rules state I must analyze first, then ask for a switch. My current plan is to delete the local file and pull.


**Evaluating the Proposed Actions**

I'm currently analyzing the situation. The terminal output shows an untracked file conflict. The user wants to overwrite their local version. My analysis concludes that deleting the local `docker/docker-compose.yaml` and then running `git pull` is the most straightforward solution, but the user's rules require that I await authorization for execution.


**Understanding the Overwrite Request**

I've carefully examined the user's explicit desire to overwrite the local `docker-compose.yaml` file, and I'm aware of the error details. The user's directive, "解决一下" (Fix it), signifies the need for direct action. My analysis leads me to the conclusion that deleting the local file and running `git pull` presents the most direct solution for the conflict. I am awaiting authorization to proceed, as per the rules.


**Examining the Core Issue**

I've reviewed the merge conflict and the user's intent to overwrite the local file. Based on the error and the prompt, I've concluded that deleting `docker/docker-compose.yaml` and then running `git pull` is the most straightforward solution. I need authorization to proceed with either the plan or execution mode.


**Decoding the Error Context**

I'm now fully immersed in the problem, recognizing the git conflict and the user's intent to overwrite the local file. The error message is clear: the untracked `docker-compose.yaml` is the culprit. My current thoughts are focused on finding the most effective and safest means to execute the overwrite request within the confines of the mode transition rules. I am analyzing the available options.


**Decomposing the Request**

I'm now fully immersed in the problem, recognizing the user's intent to overwrite the local file. The terminal output is crystal clear: an untracked `docker/docker-compose.yaml` is causing the conflict. My response will be in ANALYZE & BRAINSTORM mode. I will outline the problem, propose a solution, and request mode transition.

[MODE: ANALYZE & BRAINSTORM]

**分析 (Analysis):**
当前的 `git pull` 失败是因为本地存在一个未被 Git 追踪（untracked）的文件 `docker/docker-compose.yaml`，而远程仓库的更新中也包含了这个文件。Git 默认不会覆盖未追踪的文件以防止数据丢失。
您明确指示“覆盖本地即可”，因此我们需要删除本地的冲突文件，允许 `git pull` 正常写入远程版本。

**建议方案 (Proposed Approaches):**

1.  **Delete & Pull (推荐)**:
    *   直接删除本地的 `docker/docker-compose.yaml`。
    *   再次执行 `git pull`。
    *   **优点**: 直接、符合“覆盖本地”的意图，解决冲突最彻底。
    *   **缺点**: 本地该文件的修改（如果有）将永久丢失（符合您的要求）。

2.  **Force Reset**:
    *   使用 `git fetch --all` 然后 `git reset --hard origin/<branch>`。
    *   **优点**: 强制同步所有文件到远程状态。
    *   **缺点**: 操作较重，会重置所有文件的本地修改，不仅仅是这个未追踪文件。

**下一步 (Next Step):**
建议采用方案 1。请指示是否进入 **[MODE: PLAN]** 以制定具体的执行清单。
